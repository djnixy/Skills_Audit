        <h2>TREATING A BURN</h2>
        Burns can be very painful and you need to be careful when you are treating a burns casualty.  

        The following steps are the general <b>principles</b> for treating burns:
        <ul>
            <li>Cool the area with running water. The heat in the skin can continue to burn after the cause of burn has been <b>removed</b>. You should continue until the area feels cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>Cover the area with a <b>sterile</b> non-sticky dressing. This will help prevent further damage and infection.</li>
            <li>Monitor the casualty for shock.  If the casualty feels faint, lie him down and raise the feet a little.  Do not give food or drink.</li>

        </ul>

        <h1>TREATING A CHEMICAL BURN</h1>
        If the chemical is on the skin:
        <ul>
            <li>Wash it off <b>immediately</b></li>
            <li>Remove any clothing that has the chemical on it</li>
            <li>Cover the area with a sterile <b>dressing</b> and seek medical attention</li>


        </ul>

        If the chemical is in the eye:
        <ul>
            <li>Wash the eye with running water so the water runs away from the unaffected eye.  Turn the head to the side.</li>
            <li><b>Flush</b> the eye for up to 20 minutes.  Keep the eye open with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Cover the eye with a sterile dressing.</li>
            <li><b>Seek</b> medical attention.</li>
        </ul>
